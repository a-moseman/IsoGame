# Isometric Game Project

An open-ended projected for a multiplayer isometric game. It is currently being developed using the Godot game engine.

## Development

When working on a new feature, bug fix, etc., you should create a new branch off of the develop branch. Branches created off of main, other than develop, will be deleted. Only merges from develop into main will be accepted, so merge into develop first with your feature branch.
