# Isometric Game Project

An open-ended projected for a multiplayer isometric game. It is currently being developed using the Godot game engine.

## Setup

1. Install Godot 4.2.1

2. Ensure the executable is on your path

3. Rename the executable to godot.exe (not needed, but assumed for the commands in this section)

4. Download this repository

5. Go into the project directory

6. To run as a server, run `godot server <port>`

7. To run as a client, run `godot client <port> <addr>`, where the address and port are of an existing server.

Note: if the client and server are on different networks, you will need to set up port forwarding on the network of the server.
