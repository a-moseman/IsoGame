# Isometric Game Project

An open-ended projected for a multiplayer isometric game. It is currently being developed using the Godot game engine.

## Development

Commits should never be directly made to main or develop. Instead, they should be made to branches created off of develop. Branches made off of main will be deleted. Merges into main will only be allowed from develop. Both main and develop require PRs. PRs for merging into main should only be made if all outstanding PRs to merge into develop have been resolved.
